    <b>So-cal aka Southern California.</b><br>
    <p>So-cal aka Southern California. It has been a great place with quite a bit of ethnic diversity. 
        This diversity is great because it means there is a melting pot of cultures, which in turn means you are exposed
        to a variety of perspectives. Due to this effect it has helped shape me into who I am and I am thankful for that.
        I will carry California in my heart and hopefully bring that vibe where ever I go.

    <b>2016 marked the beginning of love for photography.</b><br> A beginning that has helped shaped how view the world. 
    This is because as I took pictures of what ever I found interesting I began to see the beauty in the mundane. I observed
    how the simplicity created beauty. This has fueled my hobby but there is another aspect that has fueled it and that has been
    using it as a means for people to see the beauty in themselves. On one such occasion I was able to take a picture of my friend
    for a dating site. After the single picture was added, the interest women showed in him skyrocketed with it skyrockted his self-esteem...
